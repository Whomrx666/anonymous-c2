## Instructions
- **HTTP**: method by attacking a vulnerable site with an http address/ip address
- **UDP**: UDP flooding works primarily by exploiting the steps a server takes when responding to a UDP packet sent to one of its ports
- **TCP**: Transmission control protocol (TCP) is an internet standard that ensures the successful exchange of data packets between devices over a network
- **RUDY**:  (Distributed DDoS) used to execute denial of service (DoS) attacks at a slow rate that gradually overloads the web server
- **SYN**: The large number of SYN connections to the web server will cause the web server to be difficult to access. This attack is one of the attacks aimed at DOS
- **NUKE**: A Nuke is a type of antiquated denial-of-service (DoS) attack carried out by sending fragmented or corrupted (usually ICMP) packets to a target machine
- **HTTPS**: DDOS attacks that target the secure web by using web addresses
